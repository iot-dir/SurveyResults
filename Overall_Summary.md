# Overall Summary and Outcomes:

In General for most of the respondents the charter is clear. 

The IoT Directorate pre-ietf meetings are useful for the members. 

Additionally, we state that each member of the IoT Directorate must do a review per quarter. 

Related to reviews approval 1 or 2 days are needed to approve or reject a review request.

In order to improve the interaction with other SDOs, we aim to organize a separate event during this year and invite people from different SDOs to provide us with the update in the IoT area.
